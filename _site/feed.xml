      By January early this year, I had been working from home for almost a year due to Covid 19. I finally decided to move out of the bay area. In hindsight, it was the biggest yet most spontaneous decision I have made in recent years.

Why did I move?
The rent and traffic
Even before the pandemic, I didn’t like the expensive rent and traffic congestion there. Everybody else was likely feeling the s...

      This article is for my future self or anyone like me who would want a clear explanation on different form of binary search.

Basic form:
Given a sorted array, find the index which has value = target.

Possible exceptional scenarios:

  This value may not exist in the array.
  There could be more than one value exists in the array, which one to return?


Why is binary search powerful?
The reason...

      It is not very common to be asked about basic sorts in interviews. However, I think these basic sorting alogorithms help build intuitions.

Overview


  
    
      Sorting Algorithms

      Worst-case Time Complexity

It is very common to see the next greater element problems these days. In this article, I will go from solving the vanilla form of this problem to analyzing and illustrating some of its variants. I will talk about when to sort, how to traverse (from left or right), and when we will need an auxiliary array.

      As a data scientist, I use Hive SQL almost everyday. When I first used Hive, I spent lots of time debugging and understanding my Hive query errors. If you are in the same situation, this article is for you:)

The major difference between Hive and relational databases like MySQL is that Hive is based on distributed system. Most of time, Hive is running within the Hadoop ecosystem, which means it...
