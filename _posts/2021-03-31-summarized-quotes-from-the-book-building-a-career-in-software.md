It's not a super lengthy book, yet it provides concrete actionable items which I think will for sure benefit the career of engineers like you and me.   
I don't own any contents below. I just organized the highlights from the book. Hope this is helpful:) 

## Tips from the book: (actionable)

### Communication and Leadership
* Practice running meetings! All this enables you to take on much bigger projects and is great preparation for leadership.
* I advise you to seek out as many opportunities to give talks as you can, because practice is the only way to improve (conditional of course on havinga subject of interest for your audience).
* Public speaking: 
    * Start with a brief anecdote, humorously delivered if possible:
    * Have a clear purpose:
    * Organize your talk into clear sections. 
    * Own the room. (Speak loudly. Deliver vigor and passion)
    * Never, ever read your slides verbatim.
    * Interact with your audience. 
    * Move fast: In an era when people can and will pull out their phones when they get bored, it’s better to move too fast for your audience than too slow.

### Creativity and self-education
* You should be reading (or watching or listening to) technical content every single weekday. 
* If you don't have any good ideas yet: keep learning. Read papers and watch talks: somewhere out there, someone is writing about technology they've built that works better than yours. 
* Ask your manager, your customers, and your teammates what they think is broken and what opportunities aren't being exploited; maybe they'll put you onto something great. 

### Principles
* To paraphrase The Effective Executive, as a knowledge worker, there's always more to do than can possibly be done; ruthless prioritization is necessary for any success, so we should cultivate it and use it to draw our line. 
* Favor explicitness and simplicity over-cleverness whenever possible.
### Tools and productivity: 
* Master the command line. If you type a command more than five times, you should script it, ideally down to five characters or less, either as shell script or an alias. 

### Habits
* Caching knowledge: 
	* An infinitely scrolling Google Doc, your cheat sheet, with a little section for each neat trick you figure out. This document should record things you might not otherwise know how to do - it is a durable repository of knowledge. 
	* A text file on your computer, your command cache, with commands you've been using particularly recently. These may or may not be hard to figure out, but they should take time to reconstruct; just copy-paste! A text file is less durable than a Google Doc, but it's much faster for frequent use. 
	* Living in the cloud: All your dotfiles and scripts should be in a private Git repository(eg. Github); all your documents should be safely stripped to a hundred servers (eg. Google doc); getting a new laptop set up to be productive shouldn't cost you more than a half hour. 
	* Keep a worklog:  
		* I keep a log of every single thing I do at work - every bug I fix, every proposal I write, every outage I work on, every presentation I give, and every person I mentor and what I mentor them about. 
		* I keep that list because sooner or later, I always have to tell the story of what I've been doing - for an annual self-review, a promotion case, or just a status report - and it's almost impossible to do without some kind of written record. 
		* I use my to-do list method from Time Management and To-Do Lists to maintain  the list; 
		* When I do something useful, I write a super fast to-do. Then I asynchronously process those to dos and put them into my doc, which is divided into a section of the year. 

### Attitudes
* What you shouldn't do: whine about not having a mentor or anything else (neither did anyone else), panic or quit. 

### Setting up career goals
* I reevaluate my situation every six months, and you should too. ... So, my cadence is every six months. My mental model is that every 6 months or year (or 18 months; the tours get longer as your projects get bigger), I sign up for a "tour of duty" - I commit to myself and to a manager that I will help them achieve some goal, and I go execute on that without a thought to leaving. 
* When is the time to go? 
	* If you feel a powerful urge to go, and that urge lasts 2-3 months, you should go; when it's time, it's time. 
	* If it seems like the interesting work on your team is done and it is converging on maintenance and small tweaks, it may be time to go. 
	* You can stay through one more planning cycle to find out; if three to six months pass, and no one can tell you about a plan that sounds impactful, it is time to go. 
	* If you really hate coming to work, it is probably time to go. 
	* If you're way behind your market wage,  make no mistake, you should get your money. 
	* If you feel like you aren't learning, it may be time to go. 
	* I believe that when what matters on your team becomes permanently boring, it's time to go to a team where what matters is interesting. 
* When choosing projects, you're optimizing for three things: learning, resume/advancement, and satisfaction.

### Project management
* You should be capable of managing a project as well as a professional project manager, just as the best technical project managers can dig into technology when they have to.
* the essential methods common to all project management are 
	* Keeping a list of all outstanding tasks—a spreadsheet, text file, JIRA board, whatever. 
	* Understanding the dependency graph of those tasks—a flowchart or a DAG2 where an edge from A to B says that B can’t be done until A is.
* How to schedule and estimate: (Four laws)
	* They’re usually artificial, but you still need to care:
	* Estimation is the hardest problem in software:
	* Therefore, pad your estimates by 2x:
		* As a special case of the principles of doing at least as well as you promise your stakeholders, it’s far better to promise late and deliver early than vice versa. Managers and product managers will try desperately to get you to shave time off your estimate; do your darnedest to resist.
	* Overcommunicate your status.

### Seek Mentorship
* you should never look to mentorship to be the engine of your growth—you should expect to teach yourself.
* Be prepared to make the most of the mentorship: 
	* You should explain your goals. 
	* Suggest that you meet every 2 weeks for 30 minutes. 
	* You will come prepared every time to discuss areas you particularly want to grow, and your mentor will share their thoughts and assign reading in those areas. 
	* You will come every time with at least two specific questions to ask. 
	* You’ll bring proposals/documents/emails for your mentor to review with you.
	* Maintain a shared 1:1 agenda, and always update the document in advance; 

### Handle Conflicts
* A related indirect option: grab a coffee together after the meeting and don’t even talk about the issue, just try to get to know each other a little better.

### Dealing with HR
* (HR) HR is, first and last, a representative of your employer. That means that it may well help you but that it represents your employer’s interests, rather than yours.
* Two principles when dealing with HR: 
	* First, I am ceaselessly my own advocate—I don’t assume that HR has done anything for me unless I see an explicit confirmation it’s happened. Lapsing on this one once left me stranded for a month without a visa! 
	* And second, when dealing with HR, including recruiters, HR Business Partners, compensation discussions, etc., etc., etc., I keep detailed records in my personal email, which has timestamps and which I fully control.

## Notions from the book: (concepts)
### Relationship with the employer 
* Your company will never do anything for you out of sentiment. 
* Your company doesn’t owe you education, career development, a raise, or a long-term guarantee of employment. 
* Everything your company does is business, not personal, and you shouldn’t take it personally. 
* You don’t owe your company your personal loyalty—they certainly don’t see themselves as owing you any. 
* When you want something from your employer, you should approach it calmly, as a negotiation between two businesses.

### You are only as good as the last problem you solve: 
* In a fast-moving industry where lots of your knowledge expires every year, even the most junior people around you constantly cook up skills you don’t have; you stay competitive by applying yourself with the determination (and even fear) of the novice. 
* You should expect to teach yourself. 

### An expert find their own work. 

### Struggle is constant 
* As you grow, you just struggle with bigger problems. ,This invariant means that avoiding struggle isn’t a goal—our goals are first to ensure that our struggles are productive (stemming from the difficulty of our goals, not the bugs in our setup), and second to manage the stress of that struggle.

### Handle risk 
* I think that means that scaling our impact requires us to gradually accept higher stakes of failure and find comfort with that responsibility; I personally meditate to try to overcome my intense natural risk aversion. I’m not suggesting you quit your job right away to found a self-funded startup; we should strive to take the highest expected value risks we can. But we should try to accept that as we grow, we need to take on more grave and lonelier responsibilities and try not to care too much.

### Tell the story 
* Your job shouldn't be just to manage an endless stream of isolated tiny tweaks. My advice: Seek out the biggest, most impactful problems you can find, deliver impact, maintain what you've built long enough to unambiguously prove success and clean up any messes you've created. Finally, evaluate whether there's a new vision to tackle; if all that's left is repeatedly repainting the house, move on; leave what you've built in superb condition for others to maintain. 
* You should almost never choose to work on a team where technology is so mature, and the vision so anemic, that your life is organized around a bug queue rather than a story. 

### Adaptability is everything 
* The promise I made myself was that I'd never go down clinging to the old ways when things had already changed or become one of the people with tons of experience that can't execute because they don't think they have to keep learning and struggling. 

### Stop worrying about the title 
* Advancement and fulfillment flow from constantly hunting the toughest, most interesting problems you can find and solving them for the sheer joy of building things. 

### Understand managers 
* (cons) Managers do almost everything through the efforts of others. Their daily problems are nurturing humans, organizing projects, and managing themselves. They send status reports, soothe the anxious, write roadmaps, scold the wrongheaded, review spreadsheets and bugs, and on and on; they hide their emotions to create an atmosphere of positivity. They virtually never do something and feel a sizzling little anything; their life is maintenance, hygiene, nudging their teams in the right direction, and waiting anxiously for their engineers to deliver. The relationship between their efforts and their outcomes is much more abstract and slippery, which means that the transition is almost always accompanied by an identity crisis—a struggle to accept life with less direct impact.
* (pros) However, managers have, to a point, authority. Their job is to be accountable for a team, and so they have automatic leverage beyond themselves, the kind of leverage individual contributors may or may not achieve through reason and persuasion. They can decide on roadmap; they’re apt to make consequential calls.

### Project management 
* Engineers always want to start on the wrong piece of a project—on the most fun piece, on the piece they know best (or least), or on just about anything other than what advances the project the most.

### Promotion 
* we should focus all our energy on (a) improving ourselves and (b) finding and executing on awesome projects, which is by far the shortest, straightest shot to a promotion.

### Meetings 
* Every meeting should achieve actionable conclusions, reviewed succinctly at the end of the meeting—otherwise, how is anyone better off?

### Managing emotions
* I think that resilience and magnanimity are two of the defining traits of true professionals and cultivating them is essential on the journey to professionalism. Your goal should be to always maintain calm and civility in group settings, even when under pressure, even when condescended to.

### Handle mistakes 
* it’s easy to avoid outages if you never do anything. 
* Good engineers push themselves, and they seldom work on perfect systems with perfect unit and integration testing; mistakes are inevitable, and some of them are going to have consequences.
* First, be completely forthright; hiding a mistake shows that you’re untrustworthy, which is much worse than causing a bug. In fact, I’ve always found that my colleagues have respected it when people stand up and take responsibility for problems. Second, don’t beat yourself up too much. Own your mistake, get a good night’s sleep, remember that you’re neither the first nor the last engineer to cause a problem, and move on.

### Vision and Identity 
* In my experience, engineers are driven above all by the desire to do work that matters, and when they feel that they’re contributing to something wonderful, other ills will be overcome, ignored, or forgiven; when people don’t buy the vision or feel an identity as a team, then no amount of nurture, fun, or money will keep them happy.
* Therefore, I think a strong vision is the most important part of a leader’s work, whether on a project, a team, or a whole organization.
